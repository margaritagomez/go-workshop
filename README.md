# Go Workshop

## Presentation
Click [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BvCaYkk_Dzeeaj4E63Bgb34BkLodKm-C4ww3XSULVsE/edit?usp=sharing) to go to the slides.

## Tools
You will need:
* An IDE, ideally [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
* [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
* [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/)

Once you've downloaded them both, open VS Code and in the extensions tab search for the Go syntax highlighter, it should appear by searching "Go".

Make sure Go was correctly installed by opening a new terminal and typing `go`. It should say `Go is a tool for managing Go source code`, along with a list of helpful commands.
